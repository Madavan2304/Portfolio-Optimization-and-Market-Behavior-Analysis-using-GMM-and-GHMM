# Algorithmic-Trading-Project

Objectives : The primary objectives of this project are twofold: portfolio optimization and stock market behavior analysis.

Portfolio Optimization:

The project aims to optimize portfolios by determining the optimal weights for a given set of stocks. This is achieved through the implementation of the Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) optimization algorithm. The objective function used is the negative Sharpe ratio, which measures the risk-adjusted return of the portfolio. By maximizing the Sharpe ratio, the project seeks to identify the optimal allocation of weights that balances the expected return and risk of the portfolio.

Stock Market Behavior Analysis:

Another crucial aspect of the project is to analyze stock market behavior using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (HMM). GMM is employed to predict clusters within the stock market data and evaluate the log-likelihood, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). This analysis helps uncover distinct behavioral patterns and groupings within the stock market. On the other hand, Gaussian HMM is used to predict hidden states, providing further insights into the underlying behavior of the stock market. The log-likelihood, BIC, and AIC are calculated to assess the performance of the model.

By leveraging these algorithms, this project aims to improve the understanding of portfolio optimization and stock market behavior analysis. The results obtained from these analyses can provide valuable insights to investors and analysts, aiding in the decision-making process and potentially enhancing portfolio performance in the dynamic stock market environment.
